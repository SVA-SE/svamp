* svamp
An R package that generates a geographic summary report for farm data in Sweden

This package is a work in progress and is currently being modified to allow others to use it.
We have removed all data from this version.

** Implementation of features in URAX

Because this project lacks maintenance and development resources, it
has been suggested that some of the features could be implemented in
an SVA tool for task management and suspicion documentation
(URAX). What follows is a draft list of features of the SVAMP software
that could be used as a guideline for future redevelopment.

*** Key features and priorities for re-implementation

The interface to the tool takes three arguments:

1. A comma separated list of PPNs
2. A comma separated list of distances in km
3. A time in days

In the feature list below, the PPN(s) in the argument will be referred
to as the 'investigated PPN(s)'. These arguments are used to subset
and match some data to produce a report. The features list here is in
no particular order with draft prioritisation (A-C) for each item;
those items without a priority are seen as unnecessary parts of the
software.

*** Feature list

**** TODO [#A] Plot the PPN(s) of interest on a map
     This feature is the plot of the PPN of interest alone on a map
     and could perhaps be ignored as a feature since it could be
     implemented in a map that just highlights these PPN(s) among all
     other PPNS on the same map.
**** TODO [#B] If the PPN(s) of interest are missing spatial identifier, give a warning
     Give a warning is the PPN of interest is missing X, Y coordinates
     and instead use the postal code as the location. In this case the
     buffers for the calculated restriction zones need to be
     calculated around the postal code polygon, not the point, or
     centroid of the postal code.
**** TODO [#B] Tabulate owner/associated person of the PPN(s) of interest
     This feature is not optimal as implemented today. I would like to
     see the development of a tool to only summarise contact
     information for a PPN in a standard data-structure like perhaps
     'vcard' that could then be passed on to the map popup, or a table
     or wherever you need it. Right now the owner information summary
     does an adhoc summary of this as does the map popup.
**** TODO [#A] Graph the number of animals by species at the PPN(s) of interest
     Just a bar graph. This could potentially be combined with the
     restriction zone graph somehow to simplify the output.
**** Tabulate the contact information for the veterinary district associated with the PPN(s) of interest
     This feature is considered to be unimportant and should not be
     considered for reimplementation in URAX.
**** TODO [#A] Tabulate and graph the number animals by species in the restriction zones defined by the distances in argument 2.
     Another set of bar graphs.
**** TODO [#B] List the PPN(s) in the restriction zones
     Just a table by their membership to the restriction zones. This
     could also be further developed to include the potential
     candidates from the postal code zones that overlap the
     restriction zones to avoid the need for that other table. This
     would just require another column for those PPN's that 'could' be
     in the zone but not with absolute certainty.
**** TODO [#A] Plot the PPN(s) of interest, restriction zones and PPN(s) in the restriction zones on a map.
     This could be the only map that is actually reimplemented if one
     also included the postal codes that intersect and split the PPN's
     into layer by species. Don't know how to deal with herds with
     multiple species in that case.
**** TODO [#A] Tabulate and graph the number herds by species in the restriction zones.
     A bar chart.
**** TODO [#B] Contact tracing for the PPN(s) of interest for the time given in argument 3
     This is currently implemented by calling an R package that does
     just this job: https://github.com/stewid/EpiContactTrace. We
     could probably leave contact tracing off of the development
     targets initially. If one wanted to do this in URAX the simplest
     method might be to call the above mentioned R package.
**** TODO [#A] tabulate herds with missing coordinates who's postal code intersect the restriction zones
     A table with the PPN's and their contact information.
**** TODO [#C] Plot map of postalcode that intersect restriction zones and contain PPN(s)
     This could become a layer on another map is is of lower
     priority.
**** tabulate SVASSS data for herds in the restriction zones
     Not important at thsi point.
**** tabulate SJV clinical data for herds in the restriction zones
     Not important currently
*** Additional features not yet implemented

**** TODO [#B] Map of herds in restriction zone(s) with layers by animal species.
     As mentioned above, there is a desire to be able to view the
     PPN:s on a map separated by species. This would facilitate the
     management and risk assessment in cases where only some species
     are at risk for the disease in question.
